<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Why Web Scraping? (Motivation)

Everywhere you look nowadays there are machines doing things for humans. A lot of things are being automated very easily with the help of the development of technology and production.
We just need all of it right now and why wouldn’t you make it easier for yourself too?
That is exactly what Web Scraping is about. It is a term used for getting the data from Web Pages online.
Once you get the data you desire, you can do a lot of things with it.

## What is Web Scraping?

Web scraping is a method used to get great amounts of data from websites and then data can be used for any kind of data manipulation and operation on it.
For this technique, we use web browsers. You usually do not have the built-in option to get that data you want. That is why we use Web Scraping to automate the process of getting that data and not having to do it manually. Web Scraping is the technique of automating this process so that instead of manually copying the data from websites.
